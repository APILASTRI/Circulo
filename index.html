        <h1>Community Detection Research</h1>
        <h2>Good Data Sets</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Data which may not have Ground Truth</li>
            <ul><li><a href="https://snap.stanford.edu/data">Stanford's InfoLab</a></li></ul>
            <li>Data with Ground Truth</li>
            <ul><li><a href="https://snap.stanford.edu/data">Stanford's InfoLab</a>
            </li></ul>
            <li>Synthetic Data Generation</li>
            <ul><li>
                Generated Graph by splitting into 4 groups [11]
               Create graph which replicates properties of graphs--Kronecker Method [Lescovec et al. 2010] 
               Need to replicate realworld properties: heavy tails for in and out-degree distribution, heavy tails for eigenvalues and eigenvectors, small diameters and desnificaiton and shrinking diameters over time.
                
                
            </li></ul>
        </ul>
        <h2>Methods of Community Detection</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Node Based</b>
                <ul><li>Given an individual node, identify the communities that the node belongs to</li></ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Component Based</b>
                <ul><li>Given a component(community), discover overlapping sub-communities within it</li></ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Nework Based</b>
                <ul><li>Given a community (nodes & edges), discover overlapping sub-communities within it</li></ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Use Cases</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Nodes belonging to a community are more than likely to have other properties in common [10].</li>
            <li>Enables data triage through node relationships</li>
            <li>May identify hierarchies (communities within communities)</li>
            <li>Finding partitions in nodes to promote efficiencies in distributing computation </li>
            <li>Enables centrality measures within a community</li>
            <li>Enables the identification of key edges used to link communities</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Evaluation Metrics</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Overview of using ground truth [8]</li>
            <li>These metrics were collectively suggested in the paper [14]</li>
            <li>Good paper outlining potential issues with validating community detection, 2013 [22]</li>
	    <li>Classes of metrics: Internal Connectivity, Combo of internal and external connectivity</li>
	    <li>Goodness scores (as second order testing bc increases in community scores increases goodness scores): Separability, Density, Cohesiveness, Cluster Coefficient
	    <li>For overlapping communities, we will want to use only internal and external metric values.  Combination metrics and modularity scores will result in misleading values that should be inconsistent.</li>

            <li><u><b>Vertex Clustering</b></u>: Embeds the Graph into vector space in order to use conventional data clustering methods such as k-means</li>
            <li><u><b>Cohesive Subgraph Discovery</b></u>:  This class finds communities of a particular predefined structure within the graph. For example, the structure could be a clique, n-clique, k-core, LS set, lambda set</li>
