The experiments are listed below:


#### Ground Truth Similarity Test
- File: __metrics_clustering.py__
- Goal: Determine if metrics applied to communities from Ground Truth are simialr when grouped with metrics of non Ground Truth communities. The experiemnt leverages kmeans clustering where the features are the metrics, and the observations are a set of features for a given community.
- __RUN__: python experiments/metrics_clustering.py metrics_dir dataset_name
- __RESULTS__:

#### Time vs Accuracy

For a given data set with Ground Truth, measure how the result accuracy changes with certain algorithms, specifically taking into consideration executation time (time complexity)
